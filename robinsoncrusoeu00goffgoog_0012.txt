Tne Editor cannot refrain from expresring

his satisfacticn at the very liberal encourage·
ment this little volume has met with; since he

is led to hope the plan for which he intended
it hasbeen found useful. The wc'rk hasbeen

carefully revised and corrected through·
out, and a sew inadvertencies and some
errcrs, which had crept into the former edi·
tion, have been expunged. In its now more
perfect state he once more confidently re·

commende it to the public.

Jnnrrmp, 1823.
